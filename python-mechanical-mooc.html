<h1>Python Frankenstein and the Mechanical MOOC</h1>
<div id="article">
    <p>In my continuing mission to learn programming I am digging into <em>Python</em> this week. I have made a few abortive stabs at the language in the past but the discipline of small daily doses of coding and checking in with a mentor over these last few months have sparked a love of the craft and a desire to dive in deeper.</p>
<p>Scratching a few itches with shell scripts is all fun and good but now I am directing attention to more organized courses of study. This is the Golden Age for Learning Anything and <em>wow</em> is there a lot of gold! <em>Massive Open Online Courses</em> (MOOCs) are the latest tool for making the world's learning resources accessible to self-learners and this week I came across a different type of MOOC ... the <em>Mechanical MOOC</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have a theory about MOOCs as they exist today. The first version of MOOCs--the cMOOCs--we think, are a little too unstructured for many learners, casting them into an unbounded environment of blogs, wikis, RSS feeds and other web technologies that are more than many learners can or want to manage.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the new strain of MOOCs--the xMOOCs--offered out of major universities and their spinoffs seem to be all competing to create the killer platform, and we have doubts that this can—or should--be done successfully. Usually, when sites try to do it all, they end up doing not much of it very well.</p>
<p>The lesson of open education in the past 10 years seems to be that the components of education—content, community and assessment—can be unbundled, and that sites can focus on providing one aspect of education very well. So we are combining three “best-of-breed” sites to create an offering that we think is as good or better than other approaches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mechanical MOOC offers <a class="reference external" href="http://mechanicalmooc.org/faq/">A gentle introduction to Python</a> as its first course assembled <em>Frankenstein-style</em> from parts of:</p>

</ul>
<p>This headless wonder (no instructor) was shocked into life this past Monday and spits out emails listing recommended tasks and encouragement for the experiment's eight-week duration. It is an intriguing idea that only tiny resources are required to curate the best of the web and construct an online learning experience markedly different from simply re-creating a massively scaled-up traditional classroom, assessments and timetable.</p>
<p>So I will devote a minimum of an hour every day learning Python for the duration of the Mechanical MOOC. Eight weeks of Python bootcamp should prepare me for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/">building a modern computer from first principles</a> ...</p>
