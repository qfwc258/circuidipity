`Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw .: <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/>`_ The old way of printing format strings using **%** and the new way using **.format()**:

.. code-block:: bash

    astronaut = 'Yuri Gagarin'
    astronaut_1 = 'Alan Shepard'
    launch = 'Baikonur'
    launch_1 = 'Cape Canaveral'
    date = 1961

    print "%s blasted off from %s and became the first %s to reach space in %d." % (astronaut, launch, 'human', date)
    print("{} blasted off from {} and became the first {} to reach space in {}.").format(astronaut, launch, 'human', date)
    print("{1} blasted off from {3} and became the first {5} to reach space in {6}.").format(astronaut, astronaut_1, launch, launch_1, 'human', 'American', date)
    
Output:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python e05.2.py 
    Yuri Gagarin blasted off from Baikonur and became the first human to reach space in 1961.
    Yuri Gagarin blasted off from Baikonur and became the first human to reach space in 1961.
    Alan Shepard blasted off from Cape Canaveral and became the first American to reach space in 1961.
