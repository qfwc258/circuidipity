Change a default QWERTY keyboard layout to **Colemak** on Debian.

## Let's go!

I am a recent convert to (slow) touch typing, and - surprise - it turns out we have learned new things about making keyboards since QWERTY made its appearance in the 19th century! [Colemak](https://colemak.com) is an alternative keyboard layout that - by changing the location of less than 20 keys - significantly reduces finger movement and makes typing feel much more comfortable!

No need to throw out your keyboard. It is easy to remap the keys for different layouts and toggle back and forth between mappings.

## Try out Colemak

Colemak is already installed in Debian. Display current settings in X and switch to Colemak using the `setxkbmap` command ...

```bash
setxkbmap -query
    rules:      evdev
    model:      pc105
    layout:     us
setxkbmap us -variant colemak
setxkbmap -query
    rules:      evdev
    model:      pc105
    layout:     us
    variant:    colemak
```

When I first started using Colemak my friend [Giles](http://gilesorr.com/) (longtime Dvorak user) suggested creating these easy-to-remember **aliases** in [~/.bashrc](https://github.com/vonbrownie/dotfiles/blob/master/.bashrc) to toggle between keyboard mappings ...

```bash
alias arst="setxkbmap us && ~/bin/keyboardconf"
alias asdf="setxkbmap us -variant colemak && ~/bin/keyboardconf"
```

My shell script [keyboardconf](https://github.com/vonbrownie/homebin/blob/master/keyboardconf) loads appropriate [~/.xbindkeysrc](http://www.circuidipity.com/xbindkeysrc/) and [~/.xmodmap](http://www.circuidipity.com/xmodmap/) files for different keyboard types that I use. These configuration files must be reloaded when changing a keyboard mapping.

## Colemak as default layout

Install some keyboard config tools ...

```bash
sudo apt install console-setup keyboard-configuration
```

Default keyboard layout in Debian is configured in `/etc/default/keyboard` and is shared between X and the command line ...

```bash
cat /etc/default/keyboard
    [...]
    XKBMODEL="pc105"
    XKBLAYOUT="us"
    XKBVARIANT=""
    XKBOPTIONS=""

    BACKSPACE="guess"
```

Set Colemak as the new default by either manually editing this file, or run ...

```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
```

### Compose key

### Control+Alt+Backspace

View changes ...

```bash
cat /etc/default/keyboard 
    [...]
    XKBMODEL="pc105"
    XKBLAYOUT="us"
    XKBVARIANT="colemak"
    XKBOPTIONS="terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp"

    BACKSPACE="guess"
```

Activate changes in X ...

```bash
sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=input --action=change
```

Activate changes in the console ...

```bash
sudo setupcon
```

... or reboot.

## Bootup

Set the keyboard to Colemak at bootup by modifying `/etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf` to read the keyboard mapping ...

```bash
# Load a keymap during the initramfs stage.
#
KEYMAP=y
```

Whenever modifying initramfs it is necessary to rebuild to apply changes ...

```bash
sudo update-initramfs -u
```

Happy hacking!
