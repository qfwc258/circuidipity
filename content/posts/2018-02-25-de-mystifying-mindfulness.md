*Don't just do something, sit there!*

Recently I have been experimenting with sitting meditation. Alas, no great revelations to report. [Monkey mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_monkey) is alive and well and demands bananas!

Working at it, however, *has* changed me in subtle ways and stoked my curiosity to dig deeper. I just completed an excellent online course offered by Coursera titled [De-mystifying Mindfulness](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindfulness), which combines theory with guided-meditation experiential practice. Starting with *What exactly* is *Mindfulness?*, common stereotypes are examined under the guidance of the *monk*, the *scientist*, the *ninja*, the *hippie*, and the *zombie*. Ancient ideas get remixed as **construct mindfulness** for neuroscientific investigation, and are put to work in the modern therapeutic practices of [Mindfulness-based stress reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness-based_stress_reduction) (MBSR) and [Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness-based_cognitive_therapy) (MBCT). 

Mindfulness is often associated with Buddhism. Secular mindfulness can go to great lengths to disassociate (de-mystify) modern practice from its origins. And those origins can be traced not just to one tradition - e.g. **vipassana**, or maybe **zen** - of "Buddhism" (an all-encompassing word invented only in the 19th century), nor limited to a single region or philosophy: Daoism, the Stoics, American psychologist William James and others have left their mark. Mindfulness is no longer to be left to the monks. Its a big business now. Even the *military* is [embracing mindfulness](https://www.army.mil/article/149615/improving_military_resilience_through_mindfulness_training)!

The best encounters in life always leave you with a more complete view of the land, and a forever receding view of the horizon. Ever onward! I have so many questions! But two questions in particular spur my exploration. First: What is *this*? *This* being the inner sense of perceiving and interpreting information moment to moment. Rather inaccurately, I suspect. Humans appear to perceive what we need to survive, not what makes us happy or what is necessarily true. A question that flows into my second: How can this *very same sense* make a more accurate, re-constructed sense of *itself*? How can the tool fix the tool?

I find the idea of **sati** explored in the [Satipatthana Sutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satipatthana_Sutta) very intriguing. It strikes me how much a millennia-old contemplative tradition can be approached as a 21st century secular technology. Better yet, to borrow a popular definition from software, an **open-source** technology. I have access to freely available tools to verify sati claims about physical reality, step-by-step, for myself. No magic, no permission, no end-user agreements from third-parties is required. Focusing on, say, the breath improves the skill of focus *and* makes me conscious of all the things that pull me away from the focus. Things I normally experience mindlessly. What *are* all these things that enter my awareness unbidden? And how does my body *respond* both to the object of focus and the objects that pull that focus elsewhere? Sati makes the claim that - through experience gained from diligent practice - I can learn to discern the difference between event and reaction, and elect to choose more skillful responses. Which is a good skill to cultivate, because sati invites me to consider objects of focus that might be upsetting and most likely avoided in a more therapeutic practice. Such as the idea of **impermanence**, and making it up close and personal in the visualization of my own death.

This ability of **metacognition**, to "step back" and observe the stream of consciousness, is a skill I wish to cultivate in my own mindfulness practice. Whereas the MBSR and MBCT focus on wellness benefits, I wish to explicitly develop greater awareness of **things as they are** and equanimity to observe whatever may rise and fall away. Gaining the ability to partition my awareness also addresses my earlier question: How can the (mind) tool fix the tool? By using the ability to reserve a portion of my cognition to observe and make choices elsewhere. Bootstrapping my way out of [dukkha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha), if you will. 

I have begun a daily mindfulness exercise where I set aside a block of time to focus on the breath. Breath exercises appear to be a good foundation to hone focus and note distractions. I have also begun reading "secular dharma" writers such as Stephen Batchelor (*Buddhism Without Belief*, *After Buddhism*), Joseph Goldstein (*Mindfulness*), and Jay Michaelson (*Evolving Dharma*). Something I also wish to explore in-depth are technologies - e.g. [electroencephalogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_activity_and_meditation) (EEG) - that attempt to quantify the subjective experience of mindfulness, and how that can be translated into **DIY brain hacking** tools.

New sessions of [De-Mystifying Mindfulness](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindfulness) start every few weeks. Highly recommended!
