A few generic tweaks I add to Ubuntu's configuration (location: `/etc/default/grub`) of the **GNU GRand Unified Bootloader**.

## Display menu

Default is to hide the boot menu and - after a slight delay - start loading the system. To make the menu visible, comment out the HIDDEN settings and set a TIMEOUT in seconds ...

```bash
#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0
#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true
GRUB_TIMEOUT=10
```

## Make some noise

It is a good thing to start Linux with a bit of song ...

```bash
# Uncomment to get a beep at grub start ... how about 'Close Encounters'?
GRUB_INIT_TUNE="480 900 2 1000 2 800 2 400 2 600 3"
```

## Black screen

On some devices I run into this issue: ["Black screen instead of password prompt for boot encryption"](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cryptsetup/+bug/1375435).

I have to blindly enter the passphrase for my LUKS-encrypted partitions and `ALT+F1` to console. Trying to remove GRUB options `splash` and/or `quiet` results in the inability to enter the passphrase at all and a hard reset is required.

To fix, add ...                                                    

```bash
# Force the kernel to boot in normal text mode with '=text'
GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=text
```

## Wallpaper

Add a background image saved in `.tga` format to GRUB menu ...

```bash
# Wallpaper                                                                     
GRUB_BACKGROUND="/boot/grub/grub_moon_jupiter_moons.tga"
```

Run `sudo update-grub` after any file modifications.

Happy (hacking) New Year!
