![htop](/img/screenshot/htop.png)

The `top` command displays Linux processes, and one of the first packages I install on a new Linux setup is the enhanced, interactive [htop](http://hisham.hm/htop/) viewer. Good-looking and easy to use: see CPU and MEMORY usage at a glance, system load and uptime, kill wonky processes, and more!

**Install:** On Ubuntu/Debian ...

```bash
sudo apt install htop lsof
```

## Helpful Commands

To search for a specific *process ID* (PID) just input the number in the htop window and ENTER to select.

Menu function keys `F1->F10` may conflict with desktop environment settings. Fortunately there are many keycode shortcuts, and these are the ones I find most useful ...

h
: help menu

t
: toggles the tree view which displays all related processes

l
: show all files opened by a process (uses `lsof`)

u
: select a user and display only processes belonging to that ID

/
: search for process by keyword

\
: filter processes by keyword

Shift + f
: follow a process

Shift + .
: sort menu, `Shift + i` will invert the sort

Shift + p
: shortcut to sort processes by CPU ...

Shift + m
: ... by MEMORY ...

Shift + t
: ... or TIME

Space
: toggle a tag (useful for selecting multiple processes to `kill`)

Shift + u
: remove all tags

k
: kill process menu

q
: quit

Happy hacking!
