**GRUBS** is a shell script I made for transforming removable USB storage into a dual-purpose device that is both a storage medium usable under Linux, Windows, and Mac OS and a GRUB boot device capable of loopback mounting Linux distro ISO files.

Depends: ``grub2``, ``bash``, ``sudo``, ``rsync``

Happy hacking!
