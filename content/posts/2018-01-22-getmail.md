Perish the thought ... But if you lost access to the contents of your Gmail account, how bad would it be? Not a good day, but not so bad if you have a backup! I use [getmail](http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/) to backup all my Gmail messages to my [home server](https://www.circuidipity.com/home-server/).

## Let's go!

**0.** Enable IMAP access to Gmail in `Settings->Forwarding and POP/IMAP`.

**1.** Install `getmail` and create mail directories ...

```bash
$ sudo apt install getmail4
$ mkdir -m 0700 ~/.getmail
$ mkdir -p ~/mail/{cur,new,tmp}
```

**2.** Create the configuration file `~/.getmail/getmailrc` ...

```bash
[retriever]
type = SimpleIMAPSSLRetriever
server = imap.gmail.com
mailboxes = ("[Gmail]/All Mail",)
username = USERNAME@gmail.com
password = SUPerS3CR3TPASSWORD

[destination]
type = Maildir
path = ~/mail/

[options]
# only download *new* emails
read_all = false
# do not delete emails on server
delete = false
# do not alter emails
delivered_to = false
received = false
# maximum downloads each run; 0 for no limit
max_messages_per_session = 0
# verbosity ... (2) print all actions; (1) print messages about retrieving and
# deleting messages; (0) only print warnings and errors.
verbose = 1
message_log = ~/.getmail/log
```

**3.** Run command ... 

```bash
$ getmail -v
```

`Getmail` connects to the server and downloads any new messages into `~/mail/new/`. When it runs the first time it may take a few minutes before it starts retrieving messages, and downloading the contents of **All Mail** may take several hours.

**4.** Setup a cronjob using the command `crontab -e` to run (for example) a daily backup at 05:45 ...

```bash
# m h  dom mon dow   command
45 5 * * * /usr/bin/getmail
```
