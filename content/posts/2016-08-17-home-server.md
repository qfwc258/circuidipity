Running your own **Linux home server** is a fun learning experience about how networks work and giving new life to an old laptop or using a Raspberry Pi is a cheap and cheerful way to get the job done!

Plus privacy may be important to you. Hosting your own server running your own services gives more control over your data.

## Let's go!

Install a stable, well-tested Linux distribution and provide services such as network printing and storage (NAS), perform backups, host web services and much more. Start with a minimal base configuration of [Debian](https://www.circuidipity.com/minimal-debian.html) and gain access to tens of thousands of packages ready to install.

## 0. Choose your server

**A used laptop** -  retired in favour of more current and powerful machines - can still deliver plenty of *oomph* for running a personal server. Frugal with power and come equipped with their own built-in UPS (battery)!<br />

## 1. Secure access

Use cryptographic keys to secure access to your new home server.<br />

## 2. Updates 

Fetch the latest fixes, install, and reboot (if necessary).<br />

## 3. Consoles 

A **terminal multiplexor** for creating, detaching, re-attaching work areas.<br />

## 4. Backups

Make incremental and automatic backups of a home folder to the server using SSH + rsync + cron.<br />

## 5. NAS

External USB storage + Pi turns any hard drive into a NAS.<br />

## 6. DDNS

Use a DDNS service to automatically update an IP address.<br />

## 7. Web

Host web applications using PHP + Nginx + PostgreSQL.<br />

## 8. RSS

Access news feeds over the web with Tiny Tiny RSS news reader.<br />

## 9. Print and scan

Configure a printer + scanner to receive jobs across the local network.<br />

## 10. Torrents

Use a text-based BitTorrent client combined with tmux to create a lightweight torrent server.<br />

**Happy hacking!**
