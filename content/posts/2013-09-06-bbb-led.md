Blinking an LED is the 'Hello World' of hardware. [BeagleBone Black's](http://www.circuidipity.com/getting-started-with-beaglebone-black.html) LEDs can be controlled by the user and the device can be connected with external LEDs.

## Built-in LEDs

BBB has 4 onboard LEDs that serve as indicators for various bits of the hardware and their interfaces can be accessed under `/sys/class/leds` ...

```bash
ls /sys/class/leds/
    beaglebone:green:usr0  beaglebone:green:usr1  beaglebone:green:usr2  beaglebone:green:usr3
```

The blinking 'heartbeat' LED that indicates BBB is alive and well is `beaglebone:green:usr0` ... 

```bash
## 'trigger' determines what event is monitored
ls /sys/class/leds/beaglebone\:green\:usr0/
    brightness  device  max_brightness  power  subsystem  trigger  uevent
cat /sys/class/leds/beaglebone\:green\:usr0/trigger 
    none nand-disk mmc0 mmc1 timer oneshot [heartbeat] backlight gpio cpu0 default-on transient

## stop the heart
echo none > /sys/class/leds/beaglebone\:green\:usr0/trigger
    
## turn LED on (no blinking)
echo none > /sys/class/leds/beaglebone\:green\:usr0/trigger
echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/beaglebone\:green\:usr0/brightness
    
## strobe LED (get BeagleBone's heart racing at 20 'beats' per second)
echo timer > /sys/class/leds/beaglebone\:green\:usr0/trigger
echo 25 > /sys/class/leds/beaglebone\:green\:usr0/delay_off 
echo 25 > /sys/class/leds/beaglebone\:green\:usr0/delay_on

## *whew* ... restore default heartbeat 
echo heartbeat > /sys/class/leds/beaglebone\:green\:usr0/trigger
```

## How to Use the GPIO Pins

BeagleBone Black has 65 *General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)* pins distributed on the board's P8 and P9 headers. These software-controlled pins can be configured to work with external hardware and are accessed through the Linux kernel's GPIO interfaces under `/sys/class/gpio` ...

```bash
ls /sys/class/gpio/
    export	gpiochip0  gpiochip32  gpiochip64  gpiochip96  unexport
```

What can be confusing at first glance is that a pin's number on the BeagleBone header and its GPIO number are different. Each `gpiochipX` controls 32 pins and is used to calculate the GPIO address of a pin (some of the GPIO pins are dedicated to BBB's onboard hardware and unavailable by default).

Example: Pin `P8_12` is controlled by `gpio1[12]` which translates as pin 12 on the second controller (starting from zero) ... (32 * 1) + 12 = 44. To *add* a pin for use I map GPIO_44 into the filesystem by echoing its pin number to the GPIO `export` file ...

```bash
echo 44 > /sys/class/gpio/export
ls /sys/class/gpio/
    export	gpio44	gpiochip0  gpiochip32  gpiochip64  gpiochip96  unexport
ls /sys/class/gpio/gpio44/
    active_low  direction  edge  power  subsystem  uevent  value
```

... and a new `gpio44` directory is created and the pin is available for work.

## Breadboard Blinking LED

![Breadboard](/img/bbb-ledzilla.jpg)

For my external LED experiment I use:

* red LED
* breadboard
* 470 ohm resistor
* 2 jumper wires
* penguin (optional)

Header pins `P8_1` and `P8_2` are both `GND`. Connect `P8_2` to the LED cathode and our newly-enabled `GPIO_44` pin (`P8_12`) to the LED anode.

To turn the LED on and off I input settings HIGH and LOW ...

```bash
## ON
echo high > /sys/class/gpio/gpio44/direction
## OFF
echo low > /sys/class/gpio/gpio44/direction
```

I created a tiny shell script to blink the LED ...

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Blink an LED on breadboard

PIN="44" # P8_12 is gpio1[12] = (32 * 1) + 12 = 44
GPIOPIN="/sys/class/gpio/gpio$PIN"

if [ -d "$GPIOPIN" ]; then
    echo "Blinking LED connected to Pin $PIN ..."
else
	echo $PIN > /sys/class/gpio/export
	echo "Blinking LED connected to Pin $PIN ..."
	sleep 1
fi

while true; do
	echo high > $GPIOPIN/direction
	sleep 2
	echo low > $GPIOPIN/direction
	sleep 2
done
```

... and `CTRL-C` to kill the script.

To *remove* a GPIO pin from use simply `unexport` the pin ...

```bash
echo 44 > /sys/class/gpio/unexport
```
