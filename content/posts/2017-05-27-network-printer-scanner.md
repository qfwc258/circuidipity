:penguin: [Home Server](http://www.circuidipity.com/home-server/) :: Configure a printer + scanner to receive jobs across the local network.

## Let's go!

Multi-purpose printer is an **HP Deskjet 2130** connected to a **home server running Debian** at IP address `192.168.1.88`.

## 0. Printer and scanner packages

Install a complete set of CUPS (printer) and SANE (scanner) packages on the server and grant (example) username `foo` admin privileges ...
                                                                                  
```bash                                                                
sudo apt install task-print-server
sudo adduser foo lp                                                      
sudo adduser foo lpadmin                                                 
sudo adduser foo scanner
```

## 1. Device drivers and firmware

Attach the printer to server ...
 
```bash
lsusb
    [...]
    Bus 002 Device 004: ID 03f0:e111 Hewlett-Packard
```

Some printers require additional drivers and firmware from the vendor. Libre software **HPLIP** adds support for the Deskjet and is packaged for Debian/Ubuntu ...

```bash
sudo apt install hplip printer-driver-hpijs
```

## 2. Web admin remote access

Primary configuration of CUPS is done in `/etc/cups/cupsd.conf` and a web interface is provided for administration. Modify default settings that permit only localhost access to the admin panel to allow access to all machines on local network `192.168.1.*` ... 

```bash
[...]
    
# Only listen for connections from the local machine.
#Listen localhost:631
# Listen for connections from local and remote machines.
Port 631

# Show shared printers on the local network.
Browsing On
BrowseLocalProtocols dnssd
   
[...]
    
# Web interface setting...
WebInterface Yes
    
# Restrict access to the server...
<Location />
Order allow,deny
Allow from 192.168.1.*
</Location>

# Restrict access to the admin pages...
<Location /admin>
Order allow,deny
Allow from 192.168.1.*
</Location>

# Restrict access to configuration files...
<Location /admin/conf>
AuthType Default
Require user @SYSTEM
Order allow,deny
Allow from 192.168.1.*
</Location>

# Restrict access to log files...
<Location /admin/log>
AuthType Default
Require user @SYSTEM
Order allow,deny
Allow from 192.168.1.*
</Location>
```

Restart CUPS ...

```bash
sudo systemctl restart cups.service
```

**Example:** Server at address `192.168.1.88` has admin functions available via browser at https://192.168.1.88:631/admin (Firefox warns *Your connection is not secure* on first connect; add an exception for the CUPS ssl certificate).

## 3. Add the printer

Select `Administration->Printers->Add Printer` and login with the username assigned previously to the `lpadmin` group.

![CUPS printer](/img/cups-printer.png)

Test the configuration by selecting `Maintenance->Print Test Page`.

Printer settings are saved to `/etc/cups/printers.conf`. On the command line, check printer status with `lpstat` ...

```bash
lpstat -t
    scheduler is running
    no system default destination
    device for HP_DeskJet_2130_series: hp:/usb/DeskJet_2130_series?serial=CN674...
    HP_DeskJet_2130_series accepting requests since Sat 27 May 2017 11:16:37 AM EDT
    printer HP_DeskJet_2130_series is idle.  enabled since Sat 27 May 2017 11:16:37 AM EDT
```

## 4. Access printer from a Linux client

Client machines can dispense with running a local CUPS server and its helper tools. To connect directly with the network printer, download ...

```bash
sudo apt install cups-client
```

Create `client.conf` in `$HOME` ...

```bash
mkdir ~/.cups
touch ~/.cups/client.conf
```

... and add the address of the server hosting the scanner to the file ...

```bash
ServerName 192.168.1.88
```

**Alternative:** If the Linux client machine regularly connects to printers on different networks it might prove convenient to download a more complete suite of CUPS packages - `apt install cups` - and add the network printer via the web interface address `localhost:631` or via the native printer config utility included with some desktop environments.

## 5. Add the scanner

Detect attached device on the server using `sane-find-scanner` and `scanimage` ...

```bash
sane-find-scanner
    [...]
    found USB scanner (vendor=0x03f0 [HP], product=0xe111 [DeskJet 2130 series]) at libusb:002:004
scanimage -L
    device `hpaio:/usb/DeskJet_2130_series?serial=CN674...' is a Hewlett-Packard DeskJet_2130_series all-in-one
```

Run a test ...

```bash
scanimage > test.ppm
```

... and retrieve the (grayscale) image from the server and verify the scanner is working on the local server connection (before enabling remote access to client machines).

Modify `/etc/sane.d/saned.conf` to share the scanner over the local network ...

```bash
## Access list
192.168.1.0/24
```

Setup SANE in **systemd** and check status ...

```bash
sudo systemctl enable saned.socket
sudo systemctl start saned.socket
systemctl status saned.socket
```

## 6. Access scanner from a Linux client

Install scanner tools on the client machine ...

```bash
sudo apt install sane-utils
```

Modify `/etc/sane.d/net.conf` to point the client towards the address of the server hosting the scanner ...

```bash
connect_timeout = 60
192.168.1.88                                                                
```

Verify the remote scanner is visible to the client ...

```bash
scanimage -L
    device `net:192.168.1.88:hpaio:/usb/DeskJet_2130_series?serial=CN674...' is a Hewlett-Packard DeskJet_2130_series all-in-one
```

**Note:** If the client fails to find the remote scanner, reboot the server and try again.

Run a test ...

```bash
scanimage > test2.ppm
```

For a simple, graphical scanner program give **simple-scan** a try.

Happy hacking!
