Running a `full-featured Linux <http://lubuntu.net/>`_ on this little laptop is a delight: lightweight, several hours battery life, inexpensive, and snappy performance using the **LXDE** desktop.

This device is available in a few different configurations. Mine is the non-touchscreen model **C720-2848** with (non-expandable) **2GB RAM** and a (user-replaceable) **16GB SSD** [1]_.

Let's go!
=========

0. Recovery Image
-----------------

Create a recovery image of Chrome OS (my C720 is model ``PEPPY C6A-N3C-A7O``) to enable restoring the Chromebook to its default configuration. This will require a spare USB stick of 2GB or better:

* Log into the Chromebook and let it auto update, as there sometimes are firmware updates... check the updating status in the browser at ``chrome://help``
* Insert the USB stick, enter ``chrome://imageburner`` and follow the directions to generate a recovery image

Source: `Create a Chromebook recovery image <https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1080595?hl=en>`_ 

1. Prepare install media
------------------------

Download the `64-bit trusty minimal installer <http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso>`_ and `flash the image <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick>`_ to a USB stick. An alternative (my choice) is adding the image to a `USB stick with multiple Linux installers <http://www.circuidipity.com/multi-boot-usb.html>`_. Using the minimal console installer vs. the graphical `Lubuntu installer <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/GetLubuntu>`_ provides more options during setup [2]_.

2. SeaBIOS
----------

`SeaBIOS <http://www.coreboot.org/SeaBIOS>`_ in combination with **coreboot** provides an open-source legacy BIOS that enables access to the MBR and the ability to install an alternative OS on the Chromebook. All this good stuff involves jumping through a few simple hoops and not trembling in fear at the "scary white screen" that pops up at power up stating that the boot loader detects something is **very very wrong** with the Chromebook and helpfully suggests pressing the spacebar to begin recovery. **Do not press the spacebar** or the Lubuntu installation will be wiped from disk!

There are 2 different methods for configuring SeaBIOS in preparation for installing Lubuntu. The first method uses a few simple commands in the Chrome OS shell to place the Chromebook into **developer mode** and allow booting the USB install media and replacing Chrome OS with Lubuntu. The drawback is that scary screen appears at every boot and you must press ``CTRL+L`` to boot to legacy-mode and onward to GRUB and Lubuntu (and **ignore** the helpful prompt to press spacebar and inadvertently begin the adventure of wiping clean the SSD).

The second method involves setting new flags for the write-protected **Google Binary Block** (GBB) in the device firmware. Delay at the boot screen can be reduced to a one second timeout and the legacy-mode BIOS set as the system default (no key combo required). Pressing the spacebar is disabled from doing any harm to Lubuntu (the Chromebook just beeps). The drawback is that it involves the (very simple) removal of the device's bottom cover and the temporary removal of the **write-protect screw** from the motherboard to permit flashing new flags to the GBB... and this may void the Chromebook's warranty (one of the case screws lies underneath a sticker declaring the warranty void if disturbed).

Experimenting with alternate OS installs on the Chromebook I first employed the developer mode method followed by the write-protect screw removal. I prefer configuring the device to default to legacy-mode BIOS but I have employed both methods successfully and describe their respective steps below.

**No guarantees**, though... Hopefully you enjoy equal success!

2.1 Write-Protect Screw Method
------------------------------

Disconnect power. Turn the Chromebook over facing bottom up and remove the 13 screws (not missing the one hidden under the warranty sticker). Gently pry the case off starting with the seam where the display connects to device. It comes away pretty easy.

This is what you see:

.. figure:: images/c720-chromebook-annotated-innards.png

    :width: 800px
    :height: 558px

    [ Image: [3]_ The battery lock screw is #6 and the write-protect screw is #7 ].

.. role:: warning

:warning:`WARNING!` This will **wipe out** whatever is installed on the SSD:

* Remove the write-protect screw
* Close back cover using only the battery lock screw to hold in place
* Re-connect power, boot Chromebook and wait until it displays:                           
                                                                                
.. code-block:: bash
    
    Chrome OS is missing or damaged.                                            
    Please insert a recovery USB stick or SD card.                              

* Insert USB recovery media prepared in Step 0 and it will proceed to restore Chrome OS and reboot
* At default Chrome OS "Welcome!" screen open a terminal ``CTRL+ALT+F2`` (Right-arrow)
* Login as ``chronos`` (no password), then enter ``sudo su`` for superuser access

Set new GBB flags using the ``set_gbb_flags.sh`` script in Chrome OS. To enable short **developer mode** screen (1 second timeout) followed by **default legacy mode** boot use these flags:

.. code-block:: bash

    GBB_FLAG_DEV_SCREEN_SHORT_DELAY 0×00000001
    GBB_FLAG_FORCE_DEV_SWITCH_ON 0×00000008
    GBB_FLAG_FORCE_DEV_BOOT_LEGACY 0×00000080
    GBB_FLAG_DEFAULT_DEV_BOOT_LEGACY 0×00000400

... which adds up to running in the shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    set_gbb_flags.sh 0x489

Shutdown with:

.. code-block:: bash

    # shutdown -h now

... and disconnect the power:

* Remove the bottom cover again and reinstall the write-lock screw to protect the BIOS
* Close cover and reinstall all the case screws

Re-connect the power, insert the USB stick prepared in Step 1, and power up the Chromebook [4]_.

2.2 Developer Mode Method
-------------------------

The alternative to removing the write-protect screw above is to place the Chromebook into developer mode using the Chrome OS shell before booting the USB install media:

* With the Chromebook off... Hold down ``ESC+F3`` (Refresh) keys and power on the device
* Invoke Recovery, and at the Recovery screen press ``Ctrl+D``
* Device will prompt for confirmation, press ``ENTER`` and the system reboots into developer mode
* Scary white boot screen appears and you need to press ``Ctrl+D`` to continue boot [5]_

Enable the **USB Boot** and **Legacy BIOS** modes by opening the shell with ``Ctrl+Alt+T`` and enter ``shell``. Set ``dev_boot_usb`` and ``dev_boot_legacy`` to active:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo crossystem dev_boot_usb=1
    $ sudo crossystem dev_boot_legacy=1

Insert the USB stick prepared in Step 1, reboot the Chromebook and press ``CTRL+L`` at the boot screen to enter legacy boot mode.

3. Install Lubuntu
------------------

My `visual screenshot tour <http://www.circuidipity.com/c720-lubuntubook-install.html>`_ of installing Lubuntu 14.04 - a `Long Term Support (LTS) <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases>`_ release.

The Chromebook's SSD is divided into 3 partitions:

* sda1 is a 300MB ``boot`` partition 
* sda2 is a 512MB LUKS encrypted ``swap`` partition using a **random key**
* sda3 uses the remaining space as a LUKS encrypted ``root`` partition using a **passphrase**

4. Touchpad
-----------

Lubuntu installs the ``3.13`` Linux kernel and does not support the Chromebook's touchpad. Download and install the more recent ``3.17`` kernel from `Ubuntu MainlineBuilds <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds>`_ to fix:

.. code-block:: bash                                                                
                                                                                    
    $ wget -c http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.17.1-utopic/linux-headers-3.17.1-031701-generic_3.17.1-031701.201410150735_amd64.deb
    $ wget -c http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.17.1-utopic/linux-headers-3.17.1-031701_3.17.1-031701.201410150735_all.deb
    $ wget -c http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.17.1-utopic/linux-image-3.17.1-031701-generic_3.17.1-031701.201410150735_amd64.deb
    $ sudo dpkg -i linux*.deb                                                       
                                                                                    
... and reboot.                                                       
                                                                                    
Create a touchpad configuration file in ``/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d``: 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo mkdir /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
    $ sudo cp /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-c720-touchpad.conf

Modify this file to adjust timeouts, add tap-mouse actions (2-finger tap = right-click, 3-finger tap = middle-click), and 2-finger scrolling.

My own sample config:

.. code-block:: bash

    Section "InputClass" 
        Identifier      "touchpad peppy cyapa" 
        MatchIsTouchpad "on" 
        MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*" 
        MatchProduct    "cyapa" 
        Option          "FingerLow" "5" 
        Option          "FingerHigh" "5"
        Option          "VertEdgeScroll" "0"
        Option          "VertTwoFingerScroll" "1"
        Option          "HorizTwoFingerScroll" "1"
        Option          "AreaRightEdge" "850"
        Option          "AreaLeftEdge" "50"
        Option          "TapButton1" "1"
        Option          "TapButton2" "3"
        Option          "TapButton3" "2"
    EndSection

5. SSD
------

The `swappiness <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swappiness>`_ parameter controls the preference of the kernel to move processes out of physical memory to the swap partition. Range is ``0-100``, default is set to ``60`` and lower values cause the kernel to avoid swapping and higher values prompt more frequent swap use.

Check the current swappiness value:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness

To reduce writes on the SSD set a low value of ``1`` by setting ``vm.swappiness=1`` in ``/etc/sysctl.conf``.

**TRIM** optimizes SSD performance and is enabled by adding the ``discard`` option to ``/etc/crypttab`` and ``/etc/fstab``. Lubuntu auto-magically configures ``crypttab`` but ``fstab`` needs to be set manually.

Sample ``fstab``:

.. code-block:: bash

    # <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>
    /dev/mapper/sda3_crypt /               ext4    noatime,discard,errors=remount-ro 0       1
    # /boot was on /dev/sda1 during installation
    UUID=[some_long_random_string] /boot    ext4    noatime,discard         0       2
    /dev/mapper/sda2_crypt none            swap    sw,discard              0       0

After modifying ``fstab`` update ``/boot/initrd.img-*`` by running:

.. code-block:: bash
 
    $ sudo update-initramfs -u -k all

6. Suspend
----------

To enable suspend-and-resume [6]_ create ``/etc/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/unbind_ehci`` with the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    PREREQ=""

    prereqs()
    {
            echo "${PREREQ}"
    }

    case ${1} in
            prereqs)
                    prereqs
                    exit 0
                    ;;
    esac

    log_success_msg "Unbind ehci for preventing error"
    echo -n "0000:00:1d.0" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ehci-pci/unbind
    exit 0
                      
... and make it executable:
                                                                                    
.. code-block:: bash                                                                
                                                                                    
    $ sudo chmod 755 /etc/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/unbind_ehci              
                                                                                    
Create a new ``udev`` rule ``/etc/udev/rules.d/10_disable-ehci.rules`` with the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="pci", DRIVER=="ehci_hcd", \
        RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'echo -n %k > %S%p/driver/unbind'"
                      
Update ``/boot/initrd.img-*`` by running:                                                                 
                                                                                    
.. code-block:: bash                                                                
                                                                                    
    $ sudo update-initramfs -k all -u                                               

Configure boot options in ``/etc/default/grub``:                                         
                                                                                
.. code-block:: bash                                                            
                                                                                
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor add_efi_memmap boot=local i915.modeset=1 tpm_tis.force=1 tpm_tis.interrupts=0 nmi_watchdog=panic,lapic intel_pstate=enable"
                                                                                
... save the changes and run:                                                                    
                                                                                
.. code-block:: bash                                                            
                                                                                
    $ sudo update-grub                                                          
                                                                                
A bit of a tug-of-war can erupt between ``systemd-logind`` and the ``xfce4-power-manager`` when setting the closing/opening of Lubuntubook's lid to trigger suspend/resume. I grant precedence to the settings in the power manager by disabling the ``LidSwitch`` event in ``logind``.

Add this line in ``/etc/systemd/logind.conf``:
                                                                                
.. code-block:: bash                                                            
                                                                                
    HandleLidSwitch=ignore                                                      
                                                                                
... and restart the service:                                                                
                                                                                
.. code-block:: bash                                                            
                                                                                
    $ sudo restart systemd-logind                                               

Suspend now works reliably when triggered from Lubuntu's shutdown menu. Chromebook will go to sleep and pushing the power button/opening the lid will resume the system with the desktop locked and a password prompt [7]_.

7. Keyboard Shortcuts
---------------------

Top row on the keyboard with the shortcut icons (brightness, volume, etc.) identify in Linux as the ``F1-F10`` keys and the Search key (in the ``CapsLk`` position) acts as the ``Super`` (Windows) modifier key.

Create keyboard shortcuts by first installing:

* ``xbindkeys`` - associate keys to shell commands
* ``xbacklight`` - set backlight level using RandR
* ``pulseaudio-utils`` - manage sound with ``pactl``
* ``xvkbd`` - send characters to another client 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install xbindkeys xbacklight pulseaudio-utils xvkbd

7.1 Direction, Brightness, Volume, Page Keys
--------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ xbindkeys -k

Enable the function keys to modify the sound and brightness settings by creating ``$HOME/.xbindkeysrc``:

.. code-block:: bash

    # backward/forward
    "xvkbd -xsendevent -text "\A\[Left]""
    F1 

    "xvkbd -xsendevent -text "\A\[Right]""
    F2 

    # backlight decrease/increase
    "xbacklight -dec 10"
    F6
    "xbacklight -inc 10"

Enable the new key shortcuts by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ xbindkeys

Lubuntu auto-detects ``$HOME/.xbindkeysrc``  and will run ``xbindkeys`` on the next login.

7.2 Power Key
-------------

Power key in upper-right corner ignores any configuration in the window manager and triggers poweroff without delay when pressed (easy to do by accident as its positioned next to ``backspace``).

If you want to disable the power key edit ``/etc/systemd/logind.conf`` and set ``HandlePowerKey=ignore``.

8. Wireless (optional)
----------------------

There are a few settings to modify if you want to monkey with the Chromebook's wireless chipset to improve performance [8]_.

To identify the card and parameters:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ lspci | grep -i net
    01:00.0 Network controller: Qualcomm Atheros AR9462 Wireless Network Adapter (rev 01)
    $ modinfo ath9k | grep parm
    parm:           debug:Debugging mask (uint)
    parm:           nohwcrypt:Disable hardware encryption (int)
    parm:           blink:Enable LED blink on activity (int)
    parm:           btcoex_enable:Enable wifi-BT coexistence (int)
    parm:           bt_ant_diversity:Enable WLAN/BT RX antenna diversity (int)
    parm:           ps_enable:Enable WLAN PowerSave (int)
    parm:           use_chanctx:Enable channel context for concurrency (int)

Create ``/etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf`` with the following options:

.. code-block:: bash
  
    options ath9k nohwcrypt=1 btcoex_enable=1 bt_ant_diversity=1

Sources: Lubuntubook `ath9k.conf <https://github.com/vonbrownie/linux-post-install/blob/master/config/c720_lubuntubook/etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf>`_, `ath9k wireless driver <http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/ath9k>`_ and `bluetooth coexistence <http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/ath9k/btcoex>`_

Notes

.. [1] Device information `output of lshw, lspci, and lsusb <https://github.com/vonbrownie/linux-post-install/tree/master/config/c720_lubuntubook/doc>`_.

.. [2] Specifically in this instance, the Ubuntu console installer provides a random key option for the encrypted swap partition.

.. [4] Whenever you remove battery power to the Chromebook (like opening up the case) the hardware clock on the motherboard resets to a future year (mine travelled to 2040). Providing a network connection is up during the Lubuntu installation the system should fetch a correct time from a NTP server. Otherwise fix the `fallout from an incorrect clock <https://blogs.fsfe.org/the_unconventional/2014/04/20/c720-debian/>`_ by re-mounting partitions read-only and correct filesystem timestamps using ``fsck``.

.. [5] Switching between developer and normal (non-developer) modes will remove user accounts and their associated information from your Chromebook.

.. [6] Some HOWTOs talk about adding ``modprobe.blacklist=ehci_hcd,ehci_pci`` but in Ubuntu they are compiled into the kernel. Disabling them early in boot instead appears to do the trick.

.. [7] However when suspend is triggered by closing or opening the lid the system correctly suspends and resumes but no screenlock. Attempting to enable suspend in ``light-locker`` led to a black screen after suspending and required a hard shutdown to recover.

.. [8] SSH sessions on the Chromebook often "stall" when the connection has been idle for a short period... taking several seconds to "wake up" again. Creating ``ath9k.conf`` improved things but more experimenting required.
