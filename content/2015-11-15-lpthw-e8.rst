`Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw .: <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/>`_ More printing using the newer **format()**:

.. code-block:: bash

    formatter = "{} {} {} {}"

    print(formatter).format(1, 2, 3, 4)
    print(formatter).format("one", "two", "three", "four")
    print(formatter).format(True, False, False, True)
    print(formatter).format(formatter, formatter, formatter, formatter)
    print(formatter).format(
        "I had this thing.",
        "That you could type up right.",
        "But it didn't sing.",
        "So I said goodnight."
    )
    
Output:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python e08.1.py 
    1 2 3 4
    one two three four
    True False False True
    {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {}
    I had this thing. That you could type up right. But it didn't sing. So I said goodnight.
    $
