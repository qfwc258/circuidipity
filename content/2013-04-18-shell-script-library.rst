Programming languages like Python can make use of *libraries* of code to add ready-to-go capabilities to programs. Shell scripts don't use libraries but I learned this week it is possible to *source* a file in a shell script and add functions to the script as if they were entered directly (vs spawning a subshell). Very useful in creating your own library equivalent for the shell!

There are several functions I have created in previous scripts that are self-contained in their logic and can be re-used over and over again. This function - for example - adds a test whether or not the user executing a script has root privileges ...

.. code-block:: bash

    test_root() {
    if [[ $UID -ne 0 ]]; then
        printf "\n$( penguinista ) .: $NAME requires ROOT privileges to do its job.\n"
        exit
    fi
    }

*Penguinista* is another function that draws a little ASCII penguin and *$NAME* is a variable that holds - you guessed it - the program name and is present in every shell script I write. I gathered up several other functions like this and created a `Library.sh <https://github.com/vonbrownie/linux-home-bin/blob/master/Library.sh>`_ script that I place in my PATH.

When I create a new shell script and want to access this library of functions I source it by adding ...

.. code-block:: bash

    . Library.sh

... and its contents are now available for inclusion in every script that needs it. Write once and use everywhere.

Sourcing a library file for the shell reminds me of HTML templates and CSS stylesheets for websites. Adding new functions or making improvements to existing ones in a single location means the changes ripple across every script that calls upon that location.
