**Update:** Moved to `There's no place like [a] home [server]. <http://www.circuidipity.com/home-server.html>`_

Running your own **Linux home server** is a fun learning experience about how networks work and using a `Raspberry Pi <http://www.circuidipity.com/tag-raspberry-pi.html>`_ is a cheap and cheerful way to get the job done!

Plus privacy may be important to you. Hosting your own server running your own services gives more control over your data.

Let's go!
=========

Install a stable, well-tested Linux distribution on these wee devices and provide services such as network printing and storage (NAS), perform backups, host web services and much more. Start with a minimal base configuration of Debian or Ubuntu and gain access to tens of thousands of packages ready to install.
