I want to learn about the range of components available for making circuits and how to build devices with the latest wave of ARM-powered development boards. The project entails:

* a *Daily Undertaking [of] Dedicated Effort* (DUDE) of 1 hour minimum
* 6 project days + 1 free day a week
* experiment runs for 100 days
* daily check-in with a mentor

The last point requires sending an email simply reading *'Done!'* which the mentor acknowledges by replying *'Check'*. Its a tiny mental hack that is a cool way to 1/ Establish a rhythm; 2/ Make oneself accountable and ... 3/ Conserves a mentor's valuable time. 

I am going to start with the `Make: Electronics <http://www.makershed.com/Make_Electronics_book_by_Charles_Platt_p/9780596153748.htm>`_ book and its collection of hands-on projects plus explore the hardware hacking capabilities of the new `BeagleBone Black <http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black>`_.
