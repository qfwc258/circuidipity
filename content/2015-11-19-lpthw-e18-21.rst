`Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw .: <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/>`_ How long will it take for Sebastiaan to pedal his bike to *Proxima Centauri*?

Code:

.. code-block:: bash

    import sys
    import textwrap

    script, origin = sys.argv

    name = 'Sebastiaan'
    s = 133.78

    def cyclist(boost):
        v = '-'
        h = v * (10 + int(boost))
        b = v * (6 + int(boost))
        w = v * (5 + int(boost))
        print textwrap.dedent('''
            {} __@
            {}  _`\<,_
            {}  (*)/ (*)
            ''').format(h, b, w) 

    def intro():
        cyclist(1)
        print textwrap.dedent('''
            Dutch cyclist {0} Bowier in September 2013 achieved a speed
            of {1} km/h with his VeloX3 bicycle, a new world record for a
            human powered vehicle.
            
            {0} has now offered you a ride on his bike from {2}
            to a destination of your choice! (Thanks {0}!)
            ''').format(name, s, origin)

    def itinerary(destination, distance, time, mode):
        txt = open('travelTimes.txt', 'a+')
        txt.write('\n{}->{} ({} km)\n'.format(origin, destination, distance))
        txt.write('Travel Time: {} hours by {}\n'.format(time, mode))
        txt.seek(0)
        print(txt.read())
        txt.close()
        
    def tripTime(distance, speed):
        return float(distance) / speed
        
    def trip():
        g = raw_input('Where would you like to go? > ')
        d = raw_input('Distance to {} in kilometers? Enter a digit > '.format(g))
        t = tripTime(d, s)
        cyclist(49)
        print textwrap.dedent('''
            Working the pedals at top speed with no breaks, {} would
            get you to {} in {} hours.
            ''').format(name, g, round(t, 2))
        print('Details have been added to your itinerary:')
        itinerary(g, d, round(t, 2), 'bike')    
            
    intro()
    trip()

Output:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python pedalTime.py Toronto
