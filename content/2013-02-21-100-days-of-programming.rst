Computers do not respond very well to shouting or hand-waving. Just like humans. But they are amazing polyglots and *will* respond favourably to a well-turned phrase and relish a good argument.

There are things I want to describe to my computer and share with other computers and their users. Inspired by `Matt Webb's 100 Hours <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0YdK_Tds4Y>`_ I will spend the next **100 days learning to program**. I have modified *100 hours* to *100 days* to emphasize not only a certain investment of hours but also the importance of maintaining a small but sustained effort over a stretch of time. I believe I learn better that way. Something about tortoises and hares ...

So ... the ground rules are:

* minimum 1 hour per day of focused effort
* 6 days a week 
* experiment runs for 100 days
* daily check-in with a mentor

The last point requires sending an email simply reading *'Done!'* which the mentor acknowledges by replying *'Check'*. Its been suggested to me that such a tiny hack is a cool way to 1/ Establish a rhythm; 2/ Make oneself accountable and ... 3/ Conserve a mentor's valuable time.

I will start by digging deeper into *shell scripting*. I know enough BASH to produce some one-liners and tiny scripts on Linux but there is more I want to do.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ echo 'Start anywhere but most importantly ... START TODAY.'
    Start anywhere but most importantly ... START TODAY.
