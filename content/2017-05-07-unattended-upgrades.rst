`Home Server Project #2 .: <http://www.circuidipity.com/raspberry-pi-home-server.html>`_ Fetch the latest fixes, install, and reboot (if necessary). Hands-free!

Let's go!
=========

Install ...

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt install unattended-upgrades apt-listchanges

Configuration file for the unattended-upgrades package is ``/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades``. This section controls which packages are upgraded and security updates are uncommented and enabled by default ...

.. code-block:: bash

    Unattended-Upgrade::Origins-Pattern {
        //
        [...]
        "origin=Debian,codename=${distro_codename},label=Debian-Security";
    };

Uncomment the following line to have mail sent to root when Debian auto-installs packages ...

.. code-block:: bash

    Unattended-Upgrade::Mail "root";
    
Confirm a working mail setup is in place. A package that provides ``mailx`` must be installed ...

.. code-block:: bash

    $ dpkg -l | grep mailx
    ii  bsd-mailx                     8.1.2-0.20141216cvs-2      i386         simple mail user agent

On a laptop consider enabling the ``MinimalSteps`` option. This allows an upgrade to be interrupted upon shutdown (with a slight delay) ...

.. code-block:: bash

    Unattended-Upgrade::MinimalSteps "true";

Some security updates can require the system to be rebooted. On a server I enable automatic reboot and set the reboot to occur at a specified time (instead of immediately) ...

.. code-block:: bash

    Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot "true";
    Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot-Time "04:00";

Activate unattended-upgrades by creating ``/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/02periodic``. Sample file ...

.. code-block:: bash

    // Control parameters for cron jobs by /etc/cron.daily/apt //

    // Enable the update/upgrade script (0=disable)
    APT::Periodic::Enable "1";

    // Do "apt-get update" automatically every n-days (0=disable)
    APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";

    // Run the "unattended-upgrade" security upgrade script every n-days (0=disabled)
    // Requires the package "unattended-upgrades" and will write a log in /var/log/unattended-upgrades
    APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";

    // Do "apt-get autoclean" every n-days (0=disable)
    APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "14";

    // Send report mail to root ...
    //  0:  no report             (or null string)
    //  1:  progress report       (actually any string)
    //  2:  + command outputs     (remove -qq, remove 2>/dev/null, add -d)
    //  3:  + trace on
    APT::Periodic::Verbose "2";

Confirm notifications will be sent to root ...

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat /etc/apt/listchanges.conf
    [apt]
    frontend=pager
    email_address=root
    confirm=0
    save_seen=/var/lib/apt/listchanges.db
    which=news

Upgrade information is also logged within the ``/var/log/unattended-upgrades`` directory.

Happy hacking!
