Week 2 of the `Mechanical MOOC <http://www.circuidipity.com/python-mechanical-mooc.html>`_ lurches ahead and I am finding `Codecademy <http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python>`_ very helpful in walking me through small bits of sample code. I jump between their class running in Firefox and IDLE and interactive Python in the console. Picking up a bit of shell scripting beforehand has definitely proven beneficial ... the idea of variables, conditionals, loops and creating functions translates nicely as I figure out Python's syntax.
