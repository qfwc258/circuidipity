`MITx and the Python DUDE .: <http://www.circuidipity.com/mitx-6001x.html>`_ I finished the *Week 2 Problem Set* and am working my way through this week's lectures and exercises for the Python **list** and **dictionary** data structures. While the course is "Computer Science and Programming Using Python" and emphasizes the computer science bit, I sought out another resource to shed more light on Python itself and dug into what looks to be a good Creative Commons-licensed programming book: `Automate the Boring Stuff with Python <https://automatetheboringstuff.com/>`_. 

Onward!
