A bit of unplanned Grub2 surgery

**PROBLEM:** Late night experiments `loading GRUB on USB sticks <http://www.circuidipity.com/grubs.html>`_ resulted in mucking up Grub on my host machine. After a reboot instead of a boot menu I was greeted with:

.. code-block:: bash

    grub >

Whoops.

Host boot partition is ``sda1``, LUKS-encrypted root is ``sda3``, and runs Linux kernel ``3.19.0``. Since the boot loader hadn't fallen into rescue mode there was hope that the essential stuff was in place but for some reason the config was not being read. A quick ``ls`` in the Grub shell confirmed that ``/boot/grub/grub.cfg``, kernels, initrd files were present.

**FIX:** After a few tries I found the right parameters for a manual boot... specifically ``root=/dev/mapper/sda3_crypt`` NOT ``root=/dev/sda3``:

.. code-block:: bash 

    grub> linux (hd0,1)/vmlinuz-3.19.0-031900-generic root=/dev/mapper/sda3_crypt ro
    grub> initrd (hd0,1)/initrd.img-3.19.0-031900-generic
    grub> boot 

Boot process begins, pauses for the LUKS passphrase prompt to unlock root, and makes it to the login screen. Good stuff.

Examine ``/etc/default/grub`` and everything looks OK. Update and **reinstall grub** to the MBR: 

.. code-block:: bash 

    $ sudo update-grub
    $ sudo grub-install /dev/sda

Reboot and back in business!
