Debian _stable_ setup
=====================

I created the post-install configuration shell script **debian-stable-setup.sh** to ideally be run immediately following the first successful boot into a fresh install of Debian.

Building on a `minimal install <http://www.circuidipity.com/minimal-debian.html>`_ the system will be configured to track Debian's _stable_ release. A choice of either 1) a console setup (option '-b'); or 2) a more extensive graphical interface which includes the `i3 tiling window manager <http://www.circuidipity.com/i3-tiling-window-manager.html>`_ plus a packages collection suitable for a workstation will be installed.

Depends: ``bash``

Happy hacking!
