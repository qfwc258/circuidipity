`MITx and the Python DUDE .: <http://www.circuidipity.com/mitx-6001x.html>`_ I have worked my way through all lectures and exercises and problem sets released to date. This week was all about **defensive programming**. I will have more to say about this later ... but right now I am deep into the online **Midterm Exam**.

Onward!
