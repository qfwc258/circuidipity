`Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw .: <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/>`_ I am not entirely clear about the difference between **%r** vs **%s** in string formatting. I **do** understand they call different functions (**repr** and **str**) and produce different output:

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> vessel = 'Hesperus'
    >>> print "The Wreck of the %r" % vessel
    The Wreck of the 'Hesperus'
    >>> print "The Wreck of the %s" % vessel
    The Wreck of the Hesperus
    >>>
    
As the book states, the first example is "raw output" and the second is the content more cleanly formatted for printing. Why using **repr** would be desirable under certain circumstances will probably become more clear later on.
