`Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw .: <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/>`_ I am practising printing in Python 2 using the **print()** and **format()** functions inherited from Python 3:

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> poem = 'The Wreck of the Hesperus'
    >>> poet = 'Longfellow'
    >>> print(poem + " by " + poet)
    The Wreck of the Hesperus by Longfellow
    >>> print("{}" + " by " + poet).format(poem)
    The Wreck of the Hesperus by Longfellow
    >>> print("{}" + " by " + "{}").format(poem, poet)
    The Wreck of the Hesperus by Longfellow
    >>>
