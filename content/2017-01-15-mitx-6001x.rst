MIT offers a *Massive Open Online Course* (MOOC) that aims to teach computer science using Python. This introduction is free and open to all in a two-course sequence: `Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python <https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-9>`_, and `Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science <https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computational-thinking-data-mitx-6-00-2x-5>`_. Sounds good to me!

Let's go!
=========

I enjoy programming and creating shell scripts and bits of Python `to scratch my own itches <https://github.com/vonbrownie/homebin>`_. But what I have discovered is that after intense bouts of figuring out how to solve something in code I make little follow-up effort that builds on lessons learned or gain understanding of more fundamental programming principles. Sometimes I come back to a program months later and it reads as if generated by a stranger. Its like creating the second floor of a building, suspended in air, with no foundation dug and materials left exposed to the elements!

I want to go faster and farther in programming with the **DUDE** as my trusty companion ... a *Daily Undertaking of Deliberate Effort*. Which translates as:

* set aside blocks of time free of distractions to focus on improving a skill

* push ahead with tasks of increasing complexity

* do a bit every day

* cultivate feedback

For this MOOC I will:

* set a timer for **50 minute sessions** to focus on the courseware (a double `pomodoro <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique>`_)

* work methodically through each exercise

* do the work (minimum 1 session) every day

* post weekly updates for the duration of study and check in with an **accountability partner** (who will give me a boot in the butt otherwise!)
  
I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to access world-class education where neither cost, nor location, nor schedule is a serious barrier to learning. We live in the **Age of the Possible**. Onward!
