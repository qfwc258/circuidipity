`Pelican <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/>`_ is a Python-powered **static site generator**. I design the look and layout of this site using CSS and `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/>`_ templates and write my posts as plaintext files using `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ and Pelican compiles the contents into HTML output suitable for a blog.

I like the idea of creating a static website. Some of the advantages:

* no database required ... plaintext is easy to edit, backup and move around
* plaintext allows your choice of editor
* cheap and easy to host practically anywhere ... one option: `GitHub Pages <http://pages.github.com/>`_ is a free service for hosting static HTML content 
* no database or executable code makes a website easy to secure, maintain and scale

The traditional disadvantage to using static pages for a blog has been the lack of dynamic elements - hosting feeds, user comments - but JavaScript for things like a Twitter widget to provide real-time updates and out-sourced services like Disqus for commenting are possible alternatives to work around static limitations.
 
This is how I built **Circuidipity** on Ubuntu 16.04 using Pelican.

0. Install
----------

I install Pelican and extra tools by creating a *virtual environment* using `virtualenv <http://www.circuidipity.com/python2-and-python3.html>`_ and `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_. This allows me to create a sandboxed work area specific to my blog and user separate from my default Python installation (an alternative method in Debian would be to install the ``python-pelican`` package) ...

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt install virtualenv
    $ mkdir ~/code/virtualenvs
    $ virtualenv ~/code/virtualenvs/pelican
    $ source ~/code/virtualenvs/pelican/bin/activate
    (pelican)$ pip install pelican

Upgrading: simply run ``pip install --upgrade pelican``.  

Next I create a directory to hold my blog contents and run ``pelican-quickstart`` to create a default site layout and configuration. I add my blog details and mostly accept the default choices provided (except for `pagination <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/settings.html#pagination>`_) ...

.. code-block:: bash

    (pelican)$ mkdir -p ~/code/circuidipity/www
    (pelican)$ cd ~/code/circuidipity/www
    (pelican)$ pelican-quickstart 

... and this is the layout generated ...

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tree
    .
    ├── content
    ├── develop_server.sh
    ├── fabfile.py
    ├── Makefile
    ├── output
    ├── pelicanconf.py
    └── publishconf.py

    2 directories, 5 files

1. First post
-------------

Posts go into ``content`` and I create an ``images`` subdirectory for screenshots and artwork and a ``pages`` subdirectory to hold things like an ``about`` or ``contact`` page ...

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir content/{images,pages}

Inside ``content`` create your first post ``hello_world.rst`` using reStructuredText ...

.. code-block:: rst

    ===========
    Hello World
    ===========

    :date: 2014-02-06 23:24
    :slug: hello-world
    :tags: pelican, web, python

    My *first* post using `Pelican <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/getting_started.html>`_!

Items like ``:date`` ``:tags:`` ``:slug:`` are **metadata** that can be used in the generated HTML output. These and a few others are included in Pelican and users can create their own to use in `templates <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.1.1/themes.html#theming-pelican>`_.

Save the file and test the new blog by running the Pelican built-in development server. This will take all the ``*.rst`` files and generate HTML formatted files in ``output`` and serve up the results for inspection in a browser at ``http://localhost:8000`` ...

.. code-block:: bash

    (pelican)$ make devserver

Server will continue to run in the background and re-generate any updated content for viewing. Stop server by running ``./develop_server.sh stop``.

2. Settings
-----------

Running ``pelican-quickstart`` creates 2 configuration files: ``pelicanconf.py`` and ``publishconf.py``.

Primary settings are configured in ``pelicanconf.py``. Settings can be used as variables in posts, pages, and templates. This is how `mine looks <https://github.com/vonbrownie/circuidipity/blob/master/pelicanconf.py>`_ ... some of the settings such as ``AUTHOR`` and ``SITENAME`` were generated by Pelican and some like ``WHOAMI_URL`` were created by myself.

A few of the settings like ``RELATIVE_URLS = True`` and turning off ``ATOM`` feeds are appropriate for a *test* environment but are probably things that need to be modified when its time for deployment.

The second configuration - `publishconf.py <https://github.com/vonbrownie/circuidipity/blob/master/publishconf.py>`_ - contains priority settings for publishing content.

3. Plugins
----------

`Plugins <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/plugins.html>`_ are available to extend the functionality of Pelican. I use a plugin called `neighbors <https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/neighbors>`_ that makes it easy for me to add links near the bottom to ``Newer`` and ``Older`` articles in relation to the current page. After enabling the plugin in ``pelicanconf.py`` I make use of the plugin's ``next_article`` and ``prev_article`` variables in a Jinja2-formatted template to add those navigation links ...

.. code-block:: python

    {% if article.prev_article %}
        <p class="prevpost"><i class="fa fa-arrow-left"></i> Older<br />
        <a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.prev_article.url}}">{{ article.prev_article.title }}</a></p>
    {% endif %}
    {% if article.next_article %}
        <p class="nextpost">Newer <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i><br />
        <a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.next_article.url}}">{{ article.next_article.title }}</a></p>
    {% endif %}

4. Themes
---------

Pelican includes a default theme to get you started and there is a collection of `user-created themes <https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes>`_ to choose from or `create your own <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/themes.html>`_. I chose to start from scratch and explore CSS, Jinja2 templating, `pygments <http://pygments.org/faq/>`_ and `Font Awesome icons <http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/>`_ to create my own custom theme.

5. Publish
----------

When ready to generate for deployment run ...

.. code-block:: bash

    (pelican)$ make publish

All blog contents are placed in ``output`` ready to be uploaded to a hosting service. Since everything is static content there are many options available. I use a free `project repository hosted on GitHub Pages <http://www.circuidipity.com/github-pages.html>`_.

Happy hacking!
