Raspberry Pi, Arduino, OpenWRT on routers ... Happy days are here for open source on little computers! Five years ago BeagleBoard.org released its first hacker-friendly ARM-powered development board and now I am having fun exploring their brand new *BeagleBone Black* - a $45 community-supported Linux computer.

Step 0 - Out-of-Box
===================

The original BeagleBone - released near the end of 2011 - started with the idea of making an ARM board that would fit in a small mint tin and see how much *awesomesauce* could be packed inside! `BeagleBone Black <http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black>`_ (BBB) has the same convenient size, rounded corners, and 4 mounting holes for building projects. Onboard is a 1GHz ARMv7 processor, 512MB RAM, 2GB storage, microSD slot, a microUSB port for power and connectivity, a USB host port, microHDMI, 5V power connector, and - as I am having fun exploring - 96 header pins for interfacing BBB with external hardware. A microUSB-to-USB cable is included for connecting BBB to a host machine.

BeagleBone Black is completely open source ... `hardware schematics <http://circuitco.com/support/index.php?title=BeagleBoneBlack#Hardware_Files>`_ are provided (build your own!), no *binary blobs*, no `NDA <http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs>`_ required to dive into the 4,000+ pages(!) of Texas Instruments' `AM335x processor manual <http://www.ti.com/product/am3359>`_. BBB ships with the *Angstrom Linux* distribution pre-installed ... but using an ARMv7 processor is a big plus because alternative ARM ports of the mainstream Linux distros (such as Debian) are available for the BBB without re-compiling packages. BBB is also one of the first ARM devices to fully embrace the `Linux Device Tree <http://linuxgizmos.com/introducing-the-new-beaglebone-black-kernel>`_ and will benefit from ongoing ARM improvements in mainstream kernel development and make it easier to create expansion boards (or *capes* in BBB lingo) for the device.

Step 1 - Connect to Host
========================

BeagleBone Black is designed to get the Linux user up-and-running quickly. Within a few minutes of unboxing the device I was using the provided USB cable to connect the device to my host computer (running Debian ``sid``). BBB mounts as a usb-storage device and provides a usbnet virtual-ethernet interface running a DHCP server. 

Some post-connection HOST output of interest ...

I use the *Thunar* file manager to browse the device and click on ``START.htm`` to launch BeagleBone's *Getting Started* page in a web browser.

    :align: center

Scroll down to ``Step #3: Browse to your board`` and clicking on the address of BBB's web server ``192.168.7.2`` opens the onboard documentation ``BeagleBone 101``. 

.. image:: images/bbb-101.png
    :alt: Beaglebone 101
    :align: center

Also included is a link to a self-hosted instance of the *Cloud9 IDE*  listening at ``192.168.7.2:3000`` that provides a JavaScript library called *BoneScript* for hacking on the BeagleBone's hardware. Some tiny example scripts are provided to blink LEDs and whatnot ... at first glance they remind me of Arduino code but I haven't really played with this environment (or Arduino for that matter) much yet.

*Network-Manager* auto-creates a second wired interface for the BeagleBone Black on my HOST ... allowing me to ssh into the device as ``root@192.168.7.2`` or ``root@beaglebone.local`` (Angstrom runs *Avahi* daemon by default) and no password. Will definitely need to change **that** ... but not before ...

Step 2 - Flashing updated Angstrom image
========================================

Having determined the device is working - and before diving into custom configuration - its a good idea to flash an updated Angstrom image for the BeagleBone Black to the device's onboard eMMC storage. This will require a microSD (8GB+) card and a 5V power adapter.

Download and unpack image
-------------------------

Angstrom image files for the BBB are labelled `BBB-eMMC-flasher-xxxx.xx.xx.img.xz <http://dominion.thruhere.net/koen/angstrom/beaglebone/>`_ ... Latest version as of 2 September is ``BBB-eMMC-flasher-2013.08.21.img.xz``.

Using the above image as an example ... download the ``xz-utils`` Debian package and download and unpack the Angstrom image ...

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install xz-utils
    $ wget -c http://dominion.thruhere.net/koen/angstrom/beaglebone/BBB-eMMC-flasher-2013.08.21.img.xz
    $ xz -d BBB-eMMC-flasher-2013.08.21.img.xz

Copy image to microSD
---------------------

.. warning::

    Be careful to note the proper *DeviceID* of your microSD card ... in my example I use *sdb* but your device will probably have a *different address*. Command *dd* will completely **wipe out the contents of the card**. Its not nicknamed *disk destroyer* for nothing!

Copy image to card using ``dd`` ...

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo dd if=BBB-eMMC-flasher-2013.08.21.img of=/dev/sdb bs=1M

Flash the BBB
-------------

A USB port does not supply enough power to the BBB when flashing an image to the eMMC ... the board must be connected to a 5V adapter. Luckily I was able to recycle an old Linksys power adapter that provided the necessary 5V and 2000mA and fit the power plug on the BBB.

With the BBB disconnected from HOST and powered off ... insert the Angstrom-prepared microSD card into BBB. Hold down the BOOT button (located above the microSD slot), connect the 5V adapter, and wait until you see the bank of 4 LEDs on the BBB all light up for a few seconds before releasing BOOT. A new image is now being flashed from card to BBB storage and will take approximately 50-60 minutes. Upon completion all 4 LEDs will be lit solid. Disconnect power, remove the microSD, then restore power and BBB will boot into the updated Angstrom.

Step 3 - Configuration
======================

Root password
-------------

Root with no password *oh noooooo* ... set one now ``passwd``.

You might also want to create an unprivileged user account (I did not).

Configure HOST as router
------------------------

Tip from http://shallowsky.com/blog/hardware/talking-to-beaglebone.html

When BBB is connected to my HOST via USB ... Network-Manager sets up a second wired interface ``eth1`` to connect with BBB ... and BBB connects to HOST through ``usb0`` ...

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ifconfig
    ...
    usb0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr BA:E1:A2:37:43:15
              inet addr:192.168.7.2  Bcast:192.168.7.3  Mask:255.255.255.252
              UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
              RX packets:7685 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
              TX packets:12461 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
              collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
              RX bytes:888859 (868.0 KiB)  TX bytes:13309157 (12.6 MiB)

This arrangment is OK for getting HOST and BBB talking to each other but BBB - in lieu of an additional ethernet cable - cannot reach the net. I created a tiny script that can be run as desired to configure my Linux HOST to route internet traffic for the BBB ...

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash

    # bbbIPforward.sh -- Enable internet access for my BeagleBone Black (BBB)
    # using my Linux HOST as a router

    bbbAddr="192.168.7.2"
    hostAddr="192.168.7.1"

    # Configure IP forwarding on HOST
    sudo iptables -A POSTROUTING -t nat -j MASQUERADE
    echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward > /dev/null

    # Copy ssh key to BBB for passwordless logins
    ssh-copy-id root@$bbbAddr

    # Configure BBB to use HOST as gateway
    ssh root@$bbbAddr "/sbin/route add default gw $hostAddr"

    # Backup and substitute BBB resolv.conf with HOST resolv.conf
    ssh root@$bbbAddr "mv -n /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.bak"
    scp /etc/resolv.conf root@$bbbAddr:/etc/

Date and Time
-------------

Tip from http://derekmolloy.ie/automatically-setting-the-beaglebone-black-time-using-ntp/

The BeagleBone Black does not include an onboard *Real Time Clock* (RTC) and thus loses its time and date setting after every power off. 

Set the time over the internet using an ntp server by first configuring the timezone linking ``localtime`` to your proper location in ``zoneinfo`` (in my case ``Toronto/New York``) and then running a quick one-off command to set the proper date ...

.. code-block:: bash

    # ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime
    # ntpdate -u pool.ntp.org

... but the date/time will still be lost after every shutdown.

For a more permanent solution install *NTP* ...

.. code-block:: bash

    # opkg update
    # opkg install ntp

Find local NTP servers (Canada) and edit ``/etc/ntp.conf`` ...

.. code-block:: bash

    driftfile /etc/ntp.drift
    logfile /var/log/ntpd.log

    # NTP Servers for Canada from www.pool.ntp.org
    server 0.ca.pool.ntp.org
    server 1.ca.pool.ntp.org
    server 2.ca.pool.ntp.org
    server 3.ca.pool.ntp.org
 
    # Using local hardware clock as fallback
    # Disable this when using ntpd -q -g -x as ntpdate or it will sync to itself
    # server 127.127.1.0
    # fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 14
 
    # Defining a default security setting
    restrict 192.168.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0 nomodify notrap

.. note:: 

    Angstrom uses *systemd* and init.d is replaced by *systemctl COMMAND* and files are located in */lib/systemd/system/NAME.service*.

Enable NTP services ...

.. code-block:: bash

    # systemctl enable ntpdate.service
    # systemctl enable ntpd.service
    # cat /lib/systemd/system/ntpd.service 
    [Unit]
    Description=Network Time Service
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=forking
    PIDFile=/run/ntpd.pid
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/ntpd -p /run/ntpd.pid

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    {% endhighlight %}

Modify ``ExecStart`` of ``/lib/systemd/system/ntpdate.service`` ....

.. code-block:: bash

    [Unit]
    Description=Network Time Service (one-shot ntpdate mode)
    Before=ntpd.service

    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/ntpd -q -g -x
    ExecStart=/sbin/hwclock --systohc
    RemainAfterExit=yes

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Save all changes, reboot the BBB while connected to the Internet, and verify the proper date and time are set with ``timedatectl`` ...

.. code-block:: bash

    # timedatectl
      Local time: Wed 2013-07-10 23:14:45 EDT
  Universal time: Thu 2013-07-11 03:14:45 UTC

Remote Desktop
--------------

Tip from http://digitaldiner.blogspot.ca/2013/05/quick-hint-for-beaglebone-black-user.html

In lieu of a microHDMI cable for connecting an HDMI display to the BBB the device may be configured to transmit a remote desktop to HOST.

On BBB install the ``x11vnc`` package and launch ...

.. code-block:: bash

    # opkg update
    # opkg install x11vnc
    # x11vnc -bg -o %HOME/.x11vnc.log.%VNCDISPLAY -auth /var/run/gdm/auth-for-gdm*/database -display :0  -forever

... which provides a display available for remote viewing at address ``192.168.7.2:5900``.

On my HOST I install and use the ``ssvnc`` viewer ``sudo apt-get install ssvnc``.

It works!

Step 4 - Issues and Fixes
=========================

*BeagleBone Black Rev. A5A running default Angstrom Linux*

'opkg upgrade'
--------------

*Fix:* Do not run this command or else Bad Things Will Happen.

No login screen over HDMI
-------------------------

*Issue:* BeagleBone logo appears at boot but no login screen.

*Fix:* Turns out that my powered USB hub - with keyboard attached - was not being detected by the BBB during boot. If the device thinks no keyboard or mouse is attached during boot it kills power to the microHDMI port and hence no display. You can "wake up" the display by ssh'ing into BBB and sending an ``echo 0 > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/blank`` command but it will still fail to detect a hot-plugged USB keyboard or mouse.

If I connect the keyboard (with built-in trackpoint) directly to the BBB USB port and reboot and hit SHIFT key the display springs to life and the login window appears.

*Issue:* BeagleBone logo appears at boot but no login screen (and this time its not the keyboard).

*Fix:* Creating a password for root causes the *autologin* task running at login screen to constantly fail (because it doesn't know the password) and buggers up the display. To disable autologin edit ``/etc/gdm/custom.conf`` and modify the line ``TimedLoginEnable`` from ``true`` to ``false`` ...

.. code-block:: bash

    [daemon]
    TimedLoginEnable=false

... and restart GDM with the command ``systemctl restart gdm.service``.

HDMI output goes beyond edge of display
---------------------------------------

*Issue:* Using a microHDMI-HDMI cable to connect BBB to my 1920x1200 display produces a working 1280x720 resolution working ... but the desktop area is slightly bigger than the margins of the display.

*Fix:* Needed to adjust settings on display ... modifying ``Image Setting->Video Mode->Video Mode`` to ``Image Setting->Video Mode->PC Mode``

Reference: http://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/beagleboard/sxaSIUpiZo8/__TmDqD4aJcJ

drm.debug
=========

*Issue:* A whole pile of these messages were filling dmesg ...

.. code-block:: bash

    [Mon Aug 26 03:34:00 2013] [drm:output_poll_execute], [CONNECTOR:5:HDMI-A-1] status updated from 2 to 2

... repeating every few seconds.

*Fix:* These debugging messages can safely be turned off by editing ``uEnv.txt`` located on the ``mmcblk0p1`` partition (**not** the ``uEnv.txt`` found in ``boot``).

If that partition is not auto-mounted (mine was not) then go ahead and mount it now ...

.. code-block:: bash

    # mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /media/BEAGLEBONE/

... and edit ``/media/BEAGLEBONE/uEnv.txt`` by changing the line ``optargs=quiet drm.debug=7`` to simply ``optargs=quiet`` ... Reboot and issue resolved.

resolv.conf
-----------

*Issue:* Noticed an instance where after running ``opkg update`` internet access was broken and I was getting a pile of ``wget: bad address 'feeds.angstrom-distribution.org'`` errors ... ``ifconfig`` showed I still had a good connection to LAN.

*Fix:* Discovered that ``resolv.conf`` was pointing to ``127.0.0.1``. Modified file to my router's IP address ... ran update again and everything OK.

urxvt
-----

*Issue:* Using ``urxvt`` as my terminal and ssh'ing into BBB ... some commands like ``htop`` will not run.

*Fix:* Copy ``/usr/share/terminfo/r/rxvt-unicode`` from HOST to the BBB and place in ``~/.terminfo/r/rxvt-unicode``. Same for ``rxvt-unicode-256color``. 

Reference: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Urxvt#Remote_Hosts

SSH session hangs
-----------------

*Issue:* SSH session sometimes hangs when rebooting the BBB.

*Fix:* Type ``~.`` and it should kill the SSH session.
