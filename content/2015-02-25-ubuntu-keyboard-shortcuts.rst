I am exploring **keyboard shortcuts** to improve workflow efficiency and happy to discover that Ubuntu's **Unity** desktop is configured very keyboard-friendly by default. Below are the Ubuntu/application key combos that I find most useful...

    open Dash

``Super(Hold)``
    display shortcuts

``Super-Tab``
    switch between Launcher applications

``Super-(1-9)``
    run application (1-9) on Launcher

Move windows between displays
-----------------------------

At home I connect my `Ubuntubook <http://www.circuidipity.com/c720-lubuntubook.html>`_ to an external 24" display to form a combined desktop across the 2 devices. I use **Compiz** to create a ``Control-Super-W`` key combo to move windows back and forth between displays:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-plugins-extra

Open the Dash and run ``compiz settings manager``. Enable and select the ``Window Management -> Put`` plugin and configure a key shortcut for ``Put to Next Output``.

.. image:: images/compiz_put.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Compiz Put Plugin
    :width: 899px
    :height: 565px

.. image:: images/compiz_put_next.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Compiz Put to Next Output
    :width: 899px
    :height: 565px

Built-in screen ``(1366x768)`` and external display ``(1920x1080)`` form a combined desktop of different resolutions. Select ``Put -> Misc. Options -> Activate "Avoid Offscreen"`` to ensure maximized windows are properly resized when moved between displays.

Logout and back in to activate modifications.

Chromebook keyboard shortcuts
-----------------------------

Top row on my Ubuntubook keyboard has a series of shortcut icons (brightness, volume, etc.) that identify in Linux as the ``F1-F10`` keys and the ``Search`` key (in the ``CapsLk`` position) acts as ``Super`` (Windows) modifier key.

Enable these keyboard shortcuts in Ubuntu by first installing:

* ``xbindkeys`` - associate keys to shell commands
* ``xbacklight`` - set backlight level using RandR
* ``pulseaudio-utils`` - manage sound with pactl
* ``xvkbd`` - send characters to another client

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install xbindkeys xbacklight pulseaudio-utils xvkbd

See `Chromebook to (L)ubuntubook <http://www.circuidipity.com/c720-lubuntubook.html>`_ for a sample configuration.

Next thing is to start working on my touch-typing!
