Install the latest Firefox Stable on Debian Stretch.

Create `~/opt` directory to store programs in `$HOME`. Download and unpack the latest binaries from the official website, and create a link to the executable in my PATH ...

```bash
$ wget -c -O FirefoxSetup.tar.bz2 "https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest&os=linux64&lang=en-US"
$ tar xvf FirefoxSetup.tar.bz2 -C ~/opt/
$ sudo ln -s ~/opt/firefox/firefox /usr/local/bin/

After running a minimal Ubuntu install on my laptop with LUKS encryption, the boot process would halt for ~30 seconds then generate this message ...

```bash
Gave up waiting for suspend/resume device
```

... followed by a prompt for the passphrase to unlock encrypted `home`, then continue to login.

**[ Fix! ]** System is looking for a swap device for suspend-to-disk/hibernate and fails to recognize my encrypted swap. I don't use hibernate, so I disable the task by adding kernel option `noresume`.

Modify `/etc/default/grub` ...

```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet noresume"
```

... and update ...

```bash
$ sudo update-grub
```

> The Olympus Mons mountain on Mars is so tall and yet so gently sloped that, were you suited and supplied correctly, ascending it would allow you to walk most of the way to space. Mars has a big, puffy atmosphere, taller than ours, but thereâ€™s barely anything to it at that level. 30 Pascals of pressure, which is what we get in an industrial vacuum furnace here on Earth. You may as well be in space. Imagine that. Imagine a world where you could quite literally walk to space.

**Logwatch** reported multiple attempts directed against the SSH port by a single illegal user trying to gain access to my home server. 

SSH listens on a non-standard port, password authentication and root login is disabled already in my default setup. Still, attackers should not be given the chance to keep trying their luck, and I installed `fail2ban` as another line of defense ...

```bash
$ sudo apt install fail2ban
```

Auto-starts with reasonable defaults.

*Alzheimer's disease without cognitive loss:* From 1994 through 2011, the [Religious Orders Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22471860) recruited more than a thousand Catholic nuns, priests and brothers, from across the United States, and collected over 350 brains for autopsy. Participants were drawn from a stable background of similar life experiences, education, and living standards (minimizing variables). Primary goals were to collect brain tissue from donors without dementia, and also from persons on whom clinical information had been collected prior to the onset of dementia.

Researchers were surprised to discover in post-mortem examinations that some of the brains displayed all the symptoms of full-blown Alzheimer's, but the persons had exhibited no cognitive loss while alive. After studying risk factors, the study suggests that a rich cognitive environment and a positive psychology foster a "cognitive reserve" that the brain can enlist as it routes activity around damaged regions. Conversely, clinical depression showed a strong correlation with cognitive decline.

> Once upon a time, I dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of following my fancies as a butterfly, and was unconscious of my individuality as a man. Suddenly, I awake, and there I lay, myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly dreaming that I am a man.

[Cameron Mott](https://www.theconfidentteacher.com/2017/09/a-new-school-year-and-a-new-start/) began experiencing life-threatening seizures at three years old. As her condition deteriorated, doctors chose a radical solution: remove the damaged half of her brain, a procedure known as a _hemispherectomy_. After intensive rehabilitation, she made a remarkable recovery and is now living the life of a normal teenager. The natural property of _neuroplasticity_ empowered her brain to remap the functions of the removed tissue on to the surviving hemisphere. [Not all brain surgeries](http://sapienlabs.co/the-curious-outcomes-of-neurosurgery/) have such successful outcomes, but what kind of technologies could we develop to augment the brain's natural abilities to self-heal?

On my [notes](https://www.circuidipity.com/notes/) page I wanted to make my headers into **anchor links** with a small graphic to make it easy to link to a specific section of the page.

This [post on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43164165) was helpful! Hugo already auto-generates an ID tag on each heading. I create a Hugo [shortcode](https://gohugo.io/templates/shortcode-templates/) - a partial snippet of code that can be inserted into pages - that generates the header link decorated with the `calendar` icon from [Feather Icons](https://feather.netlify.com/).

Create `layouts/shortcodes/note-heading.html` with ...  

```html
{{ $id := .Get 0 | lower | replaceRE "[^0-9a-z]" "-" | replaceRE "-+" "-" -}}
<a href="#{{ $id }}">
    <h3 id="{{ $id }}">{{- partial "svg/icons" "calendar" -}} {{ .Get 0 }}</h3>
</a>
```

Then in my markdown document I use {{</* note-heading "A note of interest " */>}} for headers.

Wipe the storage on a iMac G5 PowerPC All-in-one using a Lubuntu 16.04 Live Installer.

Download and write [lubuntu-16.04-desktop-powerpc.iso](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/16.04.1/release/lubuntu-16.04-desktop-powerpc.iso) to USB stick ...

```bash
$ sudo dd bs=1M if=lubuntu-16.04-desktop-powerpc.iso of=/dev/sdX
```

Start the iMac, pressing the `Command+Option+O+F` keys to enter OpenFirmware. At the prompt, enter ...

```bash
boot ud:,\\:tbxi
```

... and - if it works (it did) - Lubuntu live-installer boots. If not, its necessary to get the proper boot string for the USB stick. Check out [Ubuntu PowerPC FAQ](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PowerPCFAQ) for details.

When the Lubuntu desktop appears, open a terminal and overwrite the internal drive (example: `/dev/sda`) with zeros ...

```bash
$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M
```

Takes approximately 75min per 100G.

Pulseaudio for Ubuntu MATE. Sound works OK (on Thinkpad E520). Configure volume hotkeys in custom `.xbindkeysrc.thinkpad_e520` (`@DEFAULT_SINK@` was auto-detected) ...

```bash
# Volume mute/decrease/increase                      
"pactl set-sink-mute @DEFAULT_SINK@ toggle"          
    F1

"pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ +5%"           
    F3
```

Load custom file with `xbindkeys --file ~/.xbindkeysrc.thinkpad_e520`.

If `@DEFAULT_SINK@` **not** auto-detected, set manually. First, by detecting the default output source ...

```bash
pacmd list-sinks | grep -e 'name:' -e 'index'
  * index: 0                                   
        name: <alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo>

... then set it as the system wide default, by adding the following to `/etc/pulse/default.pa` ...

```bash
set-default-sink alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo
```

Restart pulseaudio with `pulseaudio -k` (kills and restarts).

> Since the late 1980s, scientists have been tracking a whale who sings at a sonic frequency higher than any other whale of its species: at 52 hertz, just above the lowest note on a tuba. It sings songs no one answers. Internet societies have been following it for years like sad Ahabs, transposing their own feelings on to it, believing they understand it. Alone in their bedrooms they hunt this whale they believe to be lonely just like them. Talk to scientists and they will say other whales can probably hear it, maybe itâ€™s deaf, maybe the whaleâ€™s song is the result of a genetic mutation. But it doesnâ€™t matter: the lonely people have taken this whale as their totem. Iâ€™ve followed it for years.

Correct the 'stripping effect' in QT applications using the **Breeze Dark** theme. Example: Transmission-qt would show file listings in alternating background colours, with every other line rendered in light background and foreground colours.

**[ Fix! ]** Offending colour is `#eff0f1`. Replaced with `#404552` in `~/.config/qt5ct/colors/breeze_dark.conf`.

Clearing the shell cache ... I originally installed `glances` via apt to `/usr/bin/glances`, then removed, then installed via pip to `/usr/local/bin/glances`. The command would show in PATH but - without an explicit path defined - would continue to try and execute from `/usr/bin`.

**[ Fix! ]**  Bash caches commands. Clear the cache of paths to executables using `hash` ...

```bash
type glances
  glances is hashed (/usr/bin/glances)
hash -d glances

Stop pulseaudio from respawning after halt (encountered in Ubuntu 16.04) ... When I kill pulseaudio with `pulseaudio -k` or `kill -9 ID` it immediately restarts ...

```bash
pgrep pulse

```

**[ Fix! ]** There is a config file `/etc/pulse/client.conf` with `autospawn = yes` set by default. I could modify that, but chose instead to create `~/.config/pulse/client.conf` and set `autospawn = no`. It works ... pulseaudio stays dead.

Setup colour scheme for vim. As per [Giles](http://www.gilesorr.com/blog/) recommendation I use [tir_black.](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2777) Place in `~/.vim/colors`.

Set as default colour scheme in `init.vim` ...

```bash
colorscheme tir_black

Colour scheme works when neovim runs in terminal. Does *not* work inside tmux. Tmux is not seeing the 256 color palette ...

```bash
tput colors
  8
