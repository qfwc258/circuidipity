My blog is made possible thanks to [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software). Text files composed in Markdown using [Neovim](http://www.circuidipity.com/neovim.html) are transformed by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) into a collection of static HTML files. Theme is provided by [Minimo](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimo/). Fonts used are [Yanone Kaffeesatz](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yanone+Kaffeesatz) and [Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu).

I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as my hosting service. Espresso, bananas, serendipity and friends are my duct tape.
