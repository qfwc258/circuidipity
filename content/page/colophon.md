> Accomplish the great task by a series of small acts -- Lao Tzu

My blog is made possible thanks to **free and open-source software**. Text files composed in Markdown using [Neovim](/neovim/) are transformed by [Hugo](/hugo/) into a collection of static HTML files. Theme is provided by [Minimo](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimo/). Fonts used are [Yanone Kaffeesatz](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yanone+Kaffeesatz) and [Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu).

I use [Netlify](/hugo/) as my hosting service. Espresso, bananas, serendipity and friends are my duct tape.
