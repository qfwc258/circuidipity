    # Reading and Writing Files
    # * close - closes the file
    # * read - reads the contents of a file... can assign the result to a variable
    # * readline - reads just one line of a text file
    # * truncate - empties the file
    # * write('stuff') - writes 'stuff' to the file

    from sys import argv

    script, filename = argv

    print "We're going to erase %r." % filename
    print "If you don't want that, hit CTRL-C (^C)."
    print "If you do want that, hit RETURN."

    raw_input("?")

    print "Opening the file..."
    # open 'r' (read (default)) 'w' writing and 'a' append
    # 'w' will truncate the file if it already exists
    target = open(filename, 'w')

    print "Truncating the file. Goodbye!"
    # truncate not necessary... 'w' already handles it
    #target.truncate()

    print "Now I'm going to ask you for three lines."

    line1 = raw_input("line 1: ")
    line2 = raw_input("line 2: ")
    line3 = raw_input("line 3: ")

    print "I'm going to write these to the file."

    target.write("{0}\n{1}\n{2}\nWhat was that last bit? I said...\n" \
        "{2}\n".format(line1, line2, line3))
    #target.write(line1)
    #target.write("\n")
    #target.write(line2)
    #target.write("\n")
    #target.write(line3)
    #target.write("\n")

    print "And finally, we close it."
    target.close()

**Bonus:** Last night I attended the monthly `Python Toronto Meetup <http://www.meetup.com/Python-Toronto/>`_. It was unintelligible (for a beginner) but inspiring (to me to learn more)! :-)
