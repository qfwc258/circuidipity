For my Openbox `rc.xml configuration <https://github.com/vonbrownie/linux-home-config/blob/master/.config/openbox/rc.xml>`_ I frequently enlist the ``Super`` (Windows) key in creating hotkey combos. Since the ``Caps_Lock`` key is larger, better placed, and rarely used I transformed it into another ``Super`` modifier key. An added bonus is that I can preserve my hotkeys configuration on keyboards lacking a dedicated ``Super`` key (example: my old Thinkpad X31) plus the new Chromebooks have a dedicated ``Search`` key in the old ``Caps_Lock`` location that by default acts as a ``Super`` key under Linux.

``xev`` is a neat utility run in the terminal that allows one to press keys and outputs the corresponding *keycode*. The ``Caps_Lock`` key is ``Keycode 66``. Create/edit ``/home/USER/.xmodmap`` ...
                                                                                
.. code-block:: bash                                                            
                                                                                
    ! Clear the caps_lock key binding                                                  
    clear lock                                                                         
    ! Convert caps_lock into a super key                                          
    keycode 66 = Super_L                                                               
    add mod4 = Super_L                                                          
                                                                                
Test the new setting by running ``xmodmap ~/.xmodmap``. Place the command in ``/home/USER/.xinitrc`` to auto-load when running ``startx``.
