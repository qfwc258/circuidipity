`MITx and the Python DUDE .: <http://www.circuidipity.com/mitx-6001x.html>`_ This week we worked through understanding the inherent complexity of problems and how to reduce them to simpler subproblems which can be solved by algorithms (step-by-step recipes).

A good example was near the beginning of the course when a bisection search algorithm was employed to progressively halve the search space to zero in on a particular integer or floating point approximation. Another interesting algorithm is **Merge sort** or "divide-and-conquer" invented by John von Neumann in 1945 for merging `separate sorted lists into a single sorted list <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort>`_.

One more week to go in the course. Onward!
