The ``top`` command displays Linux processes, and one of the first packages I install on a new Linux setup is the enhanced, interactive `htop <http://hisham.hm/htop/>`_ viewer. Good-looking and easy to use: see CPU and MEMORY usage at a glance, system load and uptime, kill wonky processes, and more!

**Install:** On Ubuntu/Debian ...

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt install htop lsof

Helpful Commands
================

To search for a specific *process ID* (PID) just input the number in the htop window and ENTER to select.

Menu function keys ``F1->F10`` may conflict with desktop environment settings. Fortunately there are many keycode shortcuts, and these are the ones I find most useful ...

``h``
    help menu

``t``
    toggles the tree view which displays all related processes

``l``
    show all files opened by a process (uses ``lsof``)

``u``
    select a user and display only processes belonging to that ID

``/``
    search for process by keyword

``\``
    filter processes by keyword

``Shift`` + ``f``
    follow a process

``Shift`` + ``.``
    sort menu, ``Shift + i`` will invert the sort

``Shift`` + ``p``
    shortcut to sort processes by CPU ...

``Shift`` + ``m``
    ... by MEMORY ...

``Shift`` + ``t``
    ... or TIME

``Space``
    toggle a tag (useful for selecting multiple processes to ``kill``)

``Shift + u``
    remove all tags

``k``
    kill process menu

``q``
    quit

Happy hacking!
