Restart network service on Ubuntu ... Sometimes after wake-from-suspend the network connection is down and network-manager's wifi ap list fails to refresh.
                                                                                
**[ FIX! ]** Simple systemd way ...                                                   
                                                                                
.. code-block:: bash                                                            
                                                                                
    $ sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service                             
                                                                                
If that doesn't work ... Try using ``nmcli`` to stop and start network-manager directly ...
                                                                                
.. code-block:: bash                                                             
                                                                                
    $ sudo nmcli networking off                                                 
    $ sudo nmcli networking on                                                  
                                                                                
Old-fashioned SysV init script method still works on 16.04 ...                
                                                                                
.. code-block:: bash                                                            
                                                                                
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart                                       
        ... or ...                                                              
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager restart                                  
                                                                                
Last resort ...                                             
                                                                                
.. code-block:: bash                                                            
                                                                                
    $ sudo ifdown -a  # -a brings down all interfaces                           
    $ sudo ifup -a
