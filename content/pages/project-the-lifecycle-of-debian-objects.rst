Chromebook-> *Jessiebook* -> **Stretchbook** and still going strong in its 4th year of heavy use. I love taking cheap and cheerful devices like the **Acer C720** and giving them a new lease on life using Linux!

A fresh start
-------------

I purchased the Chromebook a few months before **Penguicon 2014** so I would have something lightweight with a good battery life. Being unencumbered by Windows and equipped with the `SeaBIOS <https://www.coreboot.org/SeaBIOS>`_ (Coreboot) loader made it easy to install Debian. Removing the bottom cover to gain inside access is straightforward. I later replaced the original 16GB M.2 SSD storage with a 256GB stick (almost the same price I paid for the Chromebook!) which made the device even more useful.

Debian provides options during the install for pre-configured desktop environments and bundled collections of packages for various tasks, but I like to start with a minimal install and build up (and learn about) the system a step at a time ...

* Device: `Chromebook to Jessiebook <http://www.circuidipity.com/c720-chromebook-to-jessiebook.html>`_ followed by `Jessiebook to Stretchbook <http://www.circuidipity.com/jessiebook-to-stretchbook.html>`_
* Prepare: `Transform a USB stick into a boot device <http://www.circuidipity.com/multi-boot-usb.html>`_
* Install: `Minimal Debian <http://www.circuidipity.com/minimal-debian.html>`_

Roll roll roll-your-own
-----------------------

Go further ...

* More Debian: `Setting up Stretch <http://www.circuidipity.com/debian-stable-setup.html>`_
* Lightweight: `The i3 tiling window manager <http://www.circuidipity.com/i3-tiling-window-manager.html>`_
* Stylish: `It is a Breeze to make QT and GTK applications look good <http://www.circuidipity.com/breeze-qt-gtk.html>`_
* Stable + Fresh: `Backports <https://backports.debian.org/>`_; `Build a package from mentors.debian.net <http://www.circuidipity.com/build-qt5ct.html>`_; `Compile and install programs in $HOME <http://www.circuidipity.com/compile-install-homedir.html>`_
* Clones: `Install (almost) the same list of Debian packages on multiple machines <http://www.circuidipity.com/debian-package-list.html>`_

Onward
------

This "happy lappy" has served as my primary workstation - connected to an external display + `Thinkpad keyboard <http://www.circuidipity.com/thinkpad-usb-keyboard-trackpoint.html>`_ - for months at a time at home, and away to China and back, and still outputs a respectable 5-6 hours of battery life. Firefox likes to gobble up memory, but the 2GB RAM combined with solid state storage and a lightweight desktop makes a pretty snappy system. If I could upgrade the RAM as easily as the storage I would do so ... One of the factors holding me back from the latest generation of Chromebooks is the soldered-to-the-board memory and storage.

I see taking it more places and learning more things. **Happy hacking!**
