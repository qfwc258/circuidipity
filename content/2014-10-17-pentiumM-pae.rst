I have a **Thinkpad X31** with a **Pentium M** processor. A standard Ubuntu 14.04 install will bail thinking the machine has a **non-PAE** processor when in fact the CPU **does** support PAE extensions but omits reporting the necessary details. 

From the `Ubuntu Community Wiki <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PAE>`_:

    A number of older `Pentium M <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Pentium_M_microprocessors>`_ processors produced around 2003-4 (the Banias family) do not display the PAE flag, and hence a normal installation fails. However, these processors are in fact able to run the latest (and PAE-demanding) kernels if only the installation process is modified a little. The problem is not missing PAE, it's about the processor not displaying its full capabilities.

`Lubuntu <http://lubuntu.net/>`_ is a Ubuntu-based distro using the lightweight LXDE desktop (good match for older machines like the X31) and `provides instructions <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/AdvancedMethods#Pentium_M_and_Celeron_M>`_ for adding the ``forcepae`` kernel option to the Lubuntu installer. This allows the installer to correctly detect a PAE-capable processor and the system to install as desired.

My own alternative is to `prepare a GRUB-capable USB stick <http://www.circuidipity.com/multi-boot-usb.html>`_ capable of booting the Lubuntu installer + `other Linux images from the same device <http://www.circuidipity.com/multi-boot-usb.html>`_. In this scenario I create an entry in ``grub.cfg`` for Lubuntu to boot with ``forcepae`` pre-configured:

.. code-block:: bash

    menuentry "Lubuntu 14.04 LTS - 32bit Installer ('forcepae' for Pentium M)" {
    set iso="/iso/lubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-i386.iso"
    loopback loop $iso
    linux (loop)/casper/vmlinuz linux boot=casper iso-scan/filename=$iso noprompt noeject forcepae
    initrd (loop)/casper/initrd.lz
    }

See `'Transform a USB stick into a boot device packing multiple Linux distros' <http://www.circuidipity.com/multi-boot-usb.html>`_ for details.

Post-install - and **before** running any upgrades - the PAE flag needs to be set for the CPU, otherwise any attempt at upgrading the kernel will bail (package manager thinks its dealing with a non-PAE processor).

Add ``forcepae`` option to ``GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX`` in ``/etc/default/grub``:

.. code-block:: bash

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="forcepae"

Run:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo update-grub

... and reboot.

Confirm that ``/proc/cpuinfo`` displays the ``pae`` flag (0=false, 1=true):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -cim1 pae
    $ 1

Happy hacking!
